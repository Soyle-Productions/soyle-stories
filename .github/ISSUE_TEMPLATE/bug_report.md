### Title
The title should be only as long as is needed to describe what's wrong.  It should describe what did not happen correctly.  Instead of "The dialog should have opened when I clicked the button," the title should say "The dialog does not open after clicking the button."  Try not to include the details that led to the bug occuring in the title, that information should be in the ticket itself.

### Description
The description should contain the steps to reproduce the issue.  Think of this like telling an idiot how to make a sandwich.  Try to include every click or bits of input you provided the program that led to the bug

**Example:**

    1. Open a project
    2. Create a Location
    3. Open the Location List Tool
    4. Right-click the Location

Expected Result: The Location right-click menu should be open
Actual Result: The location right-click menu is not open

### Additional Information
It's important that we organize these bugs so nothing is lost.  To that end, whenever you file a new bug, please make sure you do the following:

**Projects** - Add to the `Bug Priority` project.  After submitting, select the priority.  High priority is reserved for system-breaking issues; if something completely blocks the ability to perform a given function, it is high-priority.  If something is blocked, but there are ways to work around it, it's generally medium priority.  If it's a visual glitch or a nuisance, it's low priority.
